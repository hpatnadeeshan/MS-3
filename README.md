### Design



#### Colour Scheme

# Cookbook Website Color Palette

In designing the Recipe Hub website, a carefully selected color palette has been chosen to evoke a sense of warmth, freshness, and elegance. The following color scheme is applied across the website for a cohesive and visually appealing experience:

## Colors:

1. **Primary Color: #FF6347 (Tomato)**
   - This vibrant red-orange color symbolizes the richness and warmth of cooked dishes.

2. **Secondary Color: #8F9779 (Sage)**
   - A muted green reminiscent of herbs and fresh ingredients, adding a natural and earthy feel.

3. **Accent Color: #FFD700 (Gold)**
   - Used this warm gold color for highlights and call-to-action buttons, bringing a touch of elegance.

4. **Background Color: #F5F5F5 (Silver)**
   - A light, neutral grayish background enhances readability and creates a clean, modern look.

5. **Text Color: #333333 (Charcoal)**
   - A dark charcoal color is used for text, providing high contrast against the light background for easy reading.



#### Typography

# Font Family Configuration for Headings and Body

In the CSS stylesheet, the `font-family` property has been defined to ensure a consistent and visually appealing typography across different heading levels and the body of the HTML document. The chosen font stack prioritizes specific fonts while providing fallback options for compatibility across various platforms.

## Heading Levels (h1 to h6)

- **h1, .h1**
- **h2, .h2**
- **h3, .h3**
- **h4, .h4**
- **h5, .h5**
- **h6, .h6**

For the above heading levels, the following font-family hierarchy has been established:

1. **"Merriweather Sans"**: This is the preferred font for headings, providing a clean and modern appearance.

2. **-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont**: These are system fonts for Apple devices and Blink-based browsers, ensuring a seamless and native look on these platforms.

3. **"Segoe UI"**: A Windows system font, contributing to a consistent experience for users on Windows operating systems.

4. **Roboto**: A widely used and versatile sans-serif font that serves as a reliable fallback on various platforms.

5. **"Helvetica Neue", Arial, "Noto Sans"**: Additional sans-serif options that cater to different operating systems and browsers.

6. **sans-serif**: A generic sans-serif font to cover cases where none of the specified fonts are available.

## Body

For the overall body text of the document, the same font stack is applied, promoting a cohesive and harmonious design throughout the website.
